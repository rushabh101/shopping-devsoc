# Overview

This app was my first time using flutter, it was quite easy to pick up and use as compared to native android.
I learnt more about async calls, futures and streams while working with firebase, and used them using the in-built flutter FutureBuilder and StreamBuilder, a process that was much easier than async methods in native android.
The dummy data for this shopping app comes from https://fakestoreapi.com
I also tried out BLoC state management for flutter, but eventually decided not to use it throughout the app.
While working with the http package I found the app taking a long time to reload data, so I switched to the flutter cache manager package.
For handling and storing user data I used firebase which I have worked with before.
